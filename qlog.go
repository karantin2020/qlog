	// Hooks for the logger instance. These allow firing events based on logging
	// levels and log entries. For example, to send errors to an error tracking
	// service, log to StatsD or dump the core on fatal errors.
	Hooks []Hook
	// All log entries pass through the formatter before logged to Out. The
	// included formatters are `TextFormatter` and `JSONFormatter` for which
	// TextFormatter is the default. In development (when a TTY is attached) it
	// logs with colors, but to a file it wouldn't. You can easily implement your
	// own that implements the `Formatter` interface, see the `README` or included
	// formatters for examples.
	Formatter []Formatter
	// The logging level the logger should log at. This is typically (and defaults
	// to) `logrus.Info`, which allows Info(), Warn(), Error() and Fatal() to be
	// logged.
	Level Level
	// Logger context
	Context []Field
	// Enable flag
	Enable bool
